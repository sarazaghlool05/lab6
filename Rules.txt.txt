Hey everyone! Please read carefully before doing anything!

1.I made the GitHub repo for Lab 6.
2.You’ll each find a folder with your diagram name 
  — use only your folder!
3.Paste your diagram and its explanation there.
4.Open GitHub Desktop → write a short commit message 
 (e.g. “Added activity diagram – Zeina”) 
 → click “Commit” then “Push origin.”
5.Don’t move, rename, or delete other folders.
6.Don’t touch the main branch except to push your work.

If anything looks weird, ask before doing anything.

Thanks ❤
